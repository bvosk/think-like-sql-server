# StackOverflow SQL Server Demo

## What is this?

This repo contains a `docker compose` project to go with Brent Ozar's [How to Think Like the SQL Server Engine
](https://www.brentozar.com/training/think-like-sql-server-engine/) training series. This will get you up and running in minutes without installing any dependencies.

## How to run this

First, go download the StackOverflow2010 database here: https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2015/10/how-to-download-the-stack-overflow-database-via-bittorrent/ and put it in a folder called `StackOverflow2010` at the root of this project.

Then run `./up.sh` to run the project using `docker compose`.
